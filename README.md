## The purpose of our project:
This application/website was made during COVID-19 its purpose is to allow customers to order their favorite fruit salads because of the pandemic most restaurants took the direction of delivering their services using online ordering, therefore the owner of the fruit salad restaurant wanted to create an application that gives the customer the ability to order their fruit salads with out the need to get out of their homes.

## The idea of this project:
It provides all the different types of salads to the customer using this website or application the site gives the ability to brows the different types of salads and examine the contents of this salad. If a customer likes a specific salad there is heart button that the customer can use to orders the same salad in the future and shows that the customer likes that salad. once the customer decides to buy the salad they desire chooses the quantity and according to the quantity the application calculates the total amount of money required for the customer to pay. once the customer completes these steps the delivery service is contacted automatically to take the order and deliver it to the specific customer address. The customer is notified once the delivery service receives the package.

## The journey during the coding of this project:
at the start of the project we all agreed on a certain time to meet and divide the tasks between each of contributors we also had to agree on certain viewport like the iPhone x width of 375 pixels, also we created the repository everyone creates an issue putting into detail the steps taken to complete the project in Git-hub while also adding the contributors to the project this allows all of them to access the repository where they can clone the files, make edits, add, commit, and push the edited files using the work flow (Git-Bash). After pushing the files the contributors create a pull request with a tag of “awaiting review” after checking the codes of each contributor and resolving all the conflicts the lead mentor allows the code to get merged. Finally, the project is published on Git-hub.

## The difficulties we faced during the coding:
One of the issues is that at first when we made the repository, we gave the wrong naming to the root page we named it `welcome.HTML` and had to change it to `index.HTML`, another problem is that we created files for the HTML files instead of creating a single folder containing all the files which is named index.HTML that is recognized as the root. Another problem is that the styling page used In the CSS file was named in conflict with the root styling page where the root was named `Style.css` and it was supposed to be named `basket.CS` and `home.CSS`.
